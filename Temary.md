# Temary
Cool things to learn.

## Meassure an algorithm
 - Exercise to remove duplicates.
 - Big O.
 - Introduction to Sets data structures.

## Linear data structures
 ### Linked lists.
 - What's a linked list.
 - From a pure functional point of view.
 - Implementations: pointers, references.
 - The concept of Node (generics).
 - Cost of each operation: insert, get, delete.
 - Sentinel nodes to avoid null conditions.

 ### Dynamic array.
  - What's a dynamic array.
  - Implementation.
  - Amortized cost.
  - Cost of each operation: insert, get, delete.

  ### Bitmasks.
  - What's a bitmask.
  - Basic use.
  - AND, OR, XOR, NEGATION, LEFT-SHIFT, RIGHT-SHIFT.
  - Example with Codejam and other exercise.

  ### Stacks & Queues.
  - What are Stacks and Queues.
  - LIFO, FIFO.
  - Implementations: static array.
  - Implementations: nodes.
  - Uses in real scenarios.
  - Some exercises.
  - Priority queues, just the concept.

  ### Disjoint sets.
  - What is a Disjoint set.
  - Operations in a disjoint set: union, find.
  - Implementations: cost of operations.
  - Quick union.
  - Quick find.
  - Some applications.

### Strings.
 - What's a string.
 - Common behavior in memory.
 - Cost of operations.
 - Algorithims: edit distance.
 - Algorithms: Pattern matching, just introducte the problem.
 - Algorithms: substring
